		  				<span class="tab"></span> Whole world is facing challenge to cope up with Covid-19 pandemic.Education sector is noexception this. With lockdown being imposed and schools closed, it changed the perspective of
							schools and education system. With schools closed for months, e-learning came to the forefront,
							across the world.
							<br><br>
						<span class="tab"></span>Many challenges and difficulties are faced by schools, private institutions, coaching centers,universities colleges to create a learning environment for students. Current methods which
					teachers opted like Google classroom, Zoom meeting WhatsApp groups only provided a means to
					share the content and learning materials among the students. However sharing a material is not
					only task associated with education. There are whole other tasks like assessment, grading,
					attendance, performance analysis, active interaction with teacher, clearing doubts of students,
					group discussions and active interaction with classmates, all of which is essential towards creating a
					learning environment for students.
					<br><br>
						<span class="tab"></span>However above mentioned methods fail to provide so. Many challenges are faced in
					handling the above mentioned tasks. And students with the system not being efficient and friendly
					to them suffer a lot and hence fail to deliver. Youth is the most important section of the population
					of any country. And quality education plays an important role in making it capable of steering the
					country towards a better future. With the scope of artificial intelligence in India increasing by the
					day, the education sector needs to update its strategies by taking into account the impact of AI on
					education and how it can help today’s young minds become able leaders and innovators of
					tomorrow.
					<br><br>
						<span class="tab"></span>In this regard our project titled “Unified Virtual Classroom Platform” aims to solve this problem by providing powerful tools for Educators to Create and Deliver Lessons (Live and Online),
					Grade, Advise and Engage with Learners and achieve extraordinary learning outcomes.
					<br><br>
					<span class="tab"></span> We also have prepared a questionnaire which contains basic questions about E-learning, 
					it’s use, it’s effectiveness. The sole purpose of this questionnaire is to get perspective of students, teachers and administrators about E-learning. This will provide us information about data analysis so that we can analyze the response generate a report, find out issues about current E-learning system and try to address them in our project.
					<br><br>
						<span class="tab"></span>The questionnaire has two sections. Section 1 is about personal information. For privacy purpose providing name is optional. Section 2 is about use of E-learning, which will give us information for data analysis. All the information will be treated in confidence. None of the information will be submitted to any organization whatsoever. <br> <br>
